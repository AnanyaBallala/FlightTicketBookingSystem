# FlightTicketBookingSystem
Project Concept
This project is a Flight Ticket Booking System focused on the frontend experience. It allows users to search for flights, select seats, and preview booking details. The main goal is to provide an interactive and user-friendly interface that simulates a complete flight booking workflow, without backend integration at this stage.

# Features Implemented (Frontend Version)
Flight Search: Input departure, destination, and travel dates to display matching flights.
Flight Listing: View available flights with airline, timings, duration, and fare details.
Seat Selection: Interactive seat map for choosing available seats visually.
Booking Details Preview: Review selected flight, seat, and passenger information before confirmation.
Navigation & UI: Structured pages for Home, Search Results, Booking, and Confirmation. Responsive and clean design.
Form Validation: Ensures required fields are filled before proceeding.

# Future Improvements / Backend Integration
User Authentication: Login/signup functionality to save user profiles and booking history.
Database Integration: Store flights, bookings, and users using backend (Node.js/Express + MySQL). Real-time seat availability updates.
Payment Gateway Integration: Secure payment module for completing bookings.
Booking Confirmation & Notifications: Generate booking IDs and send email/SMS confirmations.
Admin Panel: Backend interface for adding/updating flights, managing bookings, and generating reports.
Improved Search & Filters: Sort flights by price, duration, or departure time; add round-trip and multi-city options.
Error Handling & Security: Backend validation, prevention of double bookings, and secure API calls.
